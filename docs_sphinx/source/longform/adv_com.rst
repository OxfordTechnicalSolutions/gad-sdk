Advanced commands
*****************

Advanced commands are options that can be set on the INS to enable 
functionality or change the behaviour of the INS. They are set in the 
.cfg file.

The easiest way to set these advanced commands is on the Commands tab inside 
the Advanced Tools page in NAVconfig. NAVconfig is available for Windows as 
part of NAVsuite, which is OxTS' proprietary suite of applications for 
configuring and interacting with OxTS devices. 

NAVsuite can be downloaded from the OxTS website 
https://support.oxts.com/hc/en-us/sections/115000789105-NAVsuite

You can also manually edit the file by accessing via an FTP connection to your 
INS.
