Welcome

The purpose of the Generic Aiding Data Software Development Kit (GAD SDK) is to act as 
an interface between various types of aiding data and an OxTS Inertial Navigation System (INS).  
The GAD SDK will take the aiding data from a sensor and converted into the GAD format. 
Provided that this data is in the GAD format, the sensor used to obtain it is irrelevant to the system. 
Thus, using the GAD SDK opens the door to a large array of alternative sensors which can provide 
measurement data to the INS and help it to maintain its performance in a wide array of environments and applications
where GNSS signal is poor. 

The aim of this documentation is to show how to use the GAD SDK, it falls into three parts:


**The manual**

	This is the core of the documentation, introducing Generic Aiding itself 
	along with the API you will be interfacing with in C++ and Python. 

**Examples and tutorials**

	This contains a selection of scripts included within the GAD 
	SDK to help you get started, complete with code breakdowns and explanations. 

**The reference section**

	This section contains more in-depth explanations on particular pieces of 
	functionality, commands and configuration options, and a glossary of terms 
	used throughout the GAD SDK documentation.
