My First GAD
#############

This is the simplest example of Generic Aiding. The full source code for this 
example can be found in `/examples/gal/my-first-gad.cpp`.

In this example, velocity data is sent to an OxTS INS in real time. 

Recommended prior reading:

- Building the SDK (README.md)
- :ref:`introduction`


Requirements
============

- An OxTS INS with the relevant Generic Aiding Feature Codes enabled. If you 
  are not sure whether you have the right Feature Codes or are unfamiliar with 
  them, contact support@oxts.com.
- A PC, connected to the INS via ethernet.
- The GAD SDK has been built on this machine / pre-built binaries have been 
  downloaded (not currently available).


Method
======

How to run the executable.

Linux 
-----

1. Navigate to the relevant directory in the build folder: 
   `cd <build_dir>/examples/gal`.
2. Run the executable: `./my-first-gad-example <IP> <Packets>`. This will begin 
   sending Generic Aiding packets to the specified IP address, which should be 
   set as the IP address of the INS, 
   e.g. `./my-first-gad-example 192.168.25.10 1000`. 
   
Windows
-----

1. Navigate to the relevant configuration type directory in the build folder: 
   `cd <build_dir>/examples/gal/Debug`.
2. From the command line run the executable: `my-first-gad-example.exe <IP> <Packets>`. This will begin 
   sending Generic Aiding packets to the specified IP address, which should be 
   set as the IP address of the INS, 
   e.g. `my-first-gad-example.exe 192.168.25.10 1000`. 


Source Code Breakdown
=====================

Here we run through the source code, explaining the purpose of each of the lines.

.. code-block:: c++

   #include "oxts/gal-cpp/gad.hpp"
   #include "oxts/gal-cpp/gad_handler.hpp"


These are the two includes required for most users of Generic Aiding. `gad.hpp` 
contains the `Gad` class used to form the basis of all Generic Aiding Data. 
`gad_handler.hpp` contains the `GadHandler` class, which provides functionality 
to encode and send the data packets.

Now we enter the `main()` function:

.. code-block:: c++

   int main(int argc, char * argv[])
   {
    ...
     std::string unit_ip   = argv[1];
     int num_packets       = argv[2];

There are two input arguments for this executable: the IPv4 address of 
the INS which will be receiving the data, and the number of packets to send. 
Note that there is no advanced parsing or error handling to check that the 
argument has been inputted correctly. The other variable here sets the number 
of packets to send.

.. code-block:: c++

   OxTS::GadVelocity gv = OxTS::GadVelocity(130);
   gv.SetVelNeu(0.0,0.0,0.0);
   gv.SetVelNeuVar(0.1,0.1,0.1);
   gv.SetTimeVoid();
   gv.SetAidingLeverArmFixed(0.0,0.0,1.0);
   gv.SetAidingLeverArmVar(0.01,0.01,0.01);

Next, we set up the velocity data with stream ID 130. 

The velocity is set in the North, East, Up (left-handed) coordinate system. 
Since we are creating *static* data, the velocity is zero in all axes. The 
covariance values for this data are set using the function 
:cpp:`SetVelNeuVar()`. For more information on covariances, see 
:ref:`estimatingerrors` or :ref:`velocitycovariancematrix`. 

The function :cpp:`SetTimeVoid()` indicates that the data will be sent with no 
timestamp, making it the simplest way to handle timing when working with 
Generic Aiding. In this setup, the INS will timestamp the packet upon receipt. 

The final step to fill out the data packet is to set the lever-arm between the 
IMU and the aiding device. The lever-arm is a 3D translation in the IMU frame 
from the IMU (marked on the case of the INS) to the aiding device, measured in 
metres. The covariance values on this lever-arm are then set according to how 
accurately each translation could be measured. 

.. code-block:: c++

   OxTS::GadHandler gh = OxTS::GadHandler();
   gh.SetEncoderToBin();
   gh.SetOutputModeToUdp(unit_ip);

This block of code initialises an instance of the `GadHandler` and sets it up 
to send binary Generic Aiding data via UDP. 

.. code-block:: c++

   for (int i = 0; i < num_packets; ++i)
   {
     gh.SendPacket(gv);
     std::cout << "packet " << i << " sent" << std::endl;
     OxTS::Sleep(100);
   }


This final code block creates a `for` loop in which the Generic Aiding data is 
encoded and sent via UDP to the INS. With :cpp:`OxTS::Sleep(100)`, the data 
will be sent at a rate of ~10Hz.


Is my data being received by the INS?
=====================================

If you are unsure whether the INS is using the GAD, see 
:ref:`debugging`.
